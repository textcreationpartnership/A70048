            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

The subject of them is taken from the observations of several <hi>Natures, Humors,</hi> and <hi>Dispositions;</hi> and whilst I name no body, let no body name them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if they be wise. They differ from <hi>Pourtracts,</hi> in that they are onely <hi>Pictures of Mind,</hi> abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Body,</hi> and from <hi>Essays,</hi> in that they discourse not, but give you onely the heads of things in general, and that so briefly, as every Line is a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and every two a <hi>Period,</hi> to avoid all super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity in <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Matter.</hi> Mean time, I study more to <hi>contract,</hi> than to <hi>dilate;</hi> and like that <hi>Giant</hi> with his <hi>Iron Bed,</hi> cut off all that are too long, without Racking out those that are too short for it, to gain the double advantage by it, That those who like them not, may be glad they are no longer; and those who do, may be sorry they are so short.</p>

                     <p>HE has so many <hi>wild fancies</hi> in his Brain, as he is perpetually distracted, and more wilde when joyned with the distractions of the day. His <hi>thoughts</hi> are like a swarm of <hi>Bees</hi> buzzing up and down his head, without <hi>Consistance, Coherence,</hi> and <hi>Consequence;</hi> and there is hardly any means to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them. His <hi>head</hi> is a <hi>Leaking Fountain,</hi> and would be wholly dry, but for the continual currant of his <hi>Running Thoughts:</hi> And finally, the <hi>Figures of his Mind</hi> are all broken and disjoynted, like those of agitated Water, and it is scarcely ever so calm to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present them perfectly; onely as you have seen colours confusedly laid, contracted into some figure by the Art of <hi>Prospective;</hi> so sometimes you may make somewhat of them in <hi>Writing,</hi> when on <hi>Paper,</hi> as in a <hi>Net</hi> he catches his <hi>flying thoughts;</hi> and then you may see they have more of <hi>Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> than <hi>Heraclitus</hi> in them, that they more <hi>laugh</hi> than <hi>cry,</hi> are more <hi>merry</hi> than <hi>sad;</hi> And finally, make sport with the World, not for any <hi>ill will,</hi> but for its <hi>good,</hi> and with those in it, for their <hi>amendment,</hi> not their <hi>shame.</hi> A pattern of all which, you have in these <hi>Characters.</hi>

                     <p>A <hi>Bilk Courtier</hi> is one who has no business at <hi>Court,</hi> but onely stands in the way of those who have; he goes thither onely, that he may say he has been there, and talks as familiarly of all that is said and done there, as if it were not onely of the <hi>Court,</hi> but <hi>Council</hi> too; at first he kept back and made one of the common croud, but after put forwards, and became ridiculous: And if I might advise him, having no parts nor qualities to make himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, he should rather remain in obscurity than appear in <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Court;</hi> and be a <hi>Cipher</hi> any where, rather than make no <hi>Figure</hi> there. Above all, I would councel him to hold his peace before the <hi>Prince,</hi> whose ears are too delicate for his <hi>rude Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> who like the Ass in the Fable, seeing others fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with his <hi>Lord,</hi> thought he might be so too. Mean time I have more wondred at the desperate boldness of such as he, who having nothing worthy hearing, dare venture on Princes Ears, than at those who having no skill in swimming, dare throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into the sea. For my part, I look upon it as a thing beyond my depth, and follow that <hi>Italian</hi> Rule.</p>

She is always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining she knows not wherefore, and would fain be sick if she knew of what, giving that Physitian more who finds her a new disease, then others would those who cured them of an old. She always longs whether she be with child or no, and her cheifest longing it to be of the fashion; which she must be presently, or there starts up a new disease▪ and her Husband presently cures her of it, finding by dear experience the <hi>Mercers</hi> Book, less chargable than the <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> or the <hi>Physitian.</hi> So betwixt her being <hi>sick</hi> and <hi>well,</hi> he is never quiet with her, nor will she ever be so untill she be in the Grave.</p>

He is the perpetual Satyrist of the time, whence every one fears and hates him for it.

It is an argument of their worth, whom he speaks ill of; and of some <hi>vice</hi> or other, when he speaks well of them. He is worse than <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Buffoons,</hi> for they use their wits to delight others, he to displease; they to make them <hi>merry,</hi> but he to make them <hi>mad.</hi> Mean time, though their be small hope to make him better, yet those who applaud him, but make him worse; and though he be cowardly of himself, yet he may be hist on to mischeif others: Best way then is to take no notice, but discountenance him, &amp; he would soon desist. In fine, he abuses every one with his broad jeasting till he meet at last with some as cholerick as he is abusive, who beats him for his pains, when you will see he will go grumbling away, and say, <hi>They understand not jest,</hi> when indeed it is rather <hi>he.</hi>

Mean time, she will never be well whilst she has any thing lies on her heart, nor will she ever discharge her mind of it, and such are least fit for friendship; for a suspitious body, like Weapons loose in the <hi>Hilts,</hi> can never be used with any confidence; and that clear Understanding which should be with friends, can never be with her; who loses <hi>herself</hi> in the midst of her Suspitions, and her <hi>friends,</hi> by mistaking them for her enemies.</p>

                     <p>ALl his thoughts are on getting Wealth, and he thinks all others of his mind, like him, who hearing how <hi>Methusalem</hi> lived more than Nine hundred years, cryed out, <hi>He must needs have been a very rich man;</hi> another would have said, <hi>He must needs have been a very good, a very wiseman, &amp;c.</hi> But he thinks all is comprised in being rich. He thinks <hi>Liberality,</hi> in place of <hi>Covetousness,</hi> one of the Seven deadly sins, and that saying but <hi>Apocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha, Beatius est dare quam accipere, It is better to give, than to take,</hi> being resolved for his part, never to give any thing away. This makes him so mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as he counts <hi>Money</hi> his very Heart-Blood, and to pluck any out of his Purse, were to pluck a Tooth from him. So as, were he as <hi>Costive</hi> in his <hi>Body,</hi> as in his Purse, <hi>Manna</hi> nor <hi>Rhubarb</hi> could never purge him, or make him soluble. To conclude, I know not whether <hi>Midas</hi> more deserved his <hi>Asses Ears,</hi> for preferring <hi>Pan's</hi> Musick to <hi>Apollo's,</hi> or <hi>Gold,</hi> to all other things: But this, I am sure, he and I shall never agree well together; for he looks to he worshipped for his wealth, and I of all other <hi>Idols,</hi> cannot adore the <hi>Golden Calf.</hi>

                     <head>Of one who is never content.</head>
                     <p>HIs <hi>mind</hi> is like those <hi>sick bodies</hi> who turn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves perpetually in their Beds, and find <hi>rest</hi> no where, because they always carry their <hi>unrests</hi> along with them; and if <hi>content</hi> be that which makes a happy life, he who is never contented, must needs live a most unhappy one. He dislikes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, and it is not <hi>judgment</hi> but <hi>disease</hi> in him, nor is he <hi>curious,</hi> but <hi>fastidious.</hi> And it is like giving one drink in a <hi>Dropsie</hi> to humor him, yet you must, or he is not contented with you. Think then, how uneasie and unquiet lives they must needs live, who are to observe and humor him; a work much like making a Garment for the Moon, who changing perpetually, you must perpetually change your measures too. Which endless labor, that I may not be obliged unto, nor to follow his <hi>Wild-Goose</hi> Chase, loving mine ease and quietness as I do, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved hereafter not to be whirled about perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually like a <hi>Weather-Cock,</hi> with every wind of his humor, though I love his person, to abstain from his company.</p>

                        </gap>
                        <hi>Kindness</hi> was a Fruit which grew no where but in <hi>England;</hi> nor had any other Language a word to express it by. And (to say nothing of <hi>Love) Civility,</hi> and <hi>Courtesie,</hi> are names derived from <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>City,</hi> and are but extrinsical denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, friendship, and familiarity from <hi>Friends,</hi> and those of the same <hi>Family,</hi> but <hi>Kindness</hi> from those of the same <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Mind,</hi> and is so intrinsical a thing, as you must penetrate the very heart to find it out. It is the fire that melts hearts like Soft Wax unto one another, and the tenderest part of the <hi>Soul</hi> d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In fine, it hath its root in <hi>good nature,</hi> and produces nothing but <hi>good offices;</hi> and this we had once, when we might well say, That <hi>England</hi> was happy if it but knew its own happiness; but now we have wholly lost it, and onely retain the empty name. All other Nations having more <hi>Kindness,</hi> and agreeing better amongst themselves than we, thanks to the difference of <hi>Religion,</hi> which has wholly extirpated it <hi>Roof</hi> and <hi>Branch.</hi> But I say no more, least I should be thought too partial to other Nations, &amp; too injurious to ours, to exprobate to it the want of it.</p>

                     <head>Of the Parliament, In answer to the Ignorant Objections of some Strangers.</head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Parliament of England</hi> (whatever others are in other Countreys) is onely in nature of an <hi>humble Friend</hi> or <hi>faithful Counsellor</hi> to <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> to Counsel and Advise Him for His own and Kingdoms good, as often as He shall please to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble them: Nor is this more to limit or bound His <hi>Royal Power,</hi> than the <hi>Sands</hi> or <hi>Short</hi> does that of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> but onely for its own, and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, or more to derogate from it, than the <hi>impuissance</hi> of doing <hi>harm</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> does from that of <hi>Almighty God;</hi> which on the contrary, is one of His most Godlike Attributes. They are deceived then, who think nothing <hi>great,</hi> but what is <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous,</hi> or that to Raign Courteously, is but to Raign at others Courtesies: The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is as absolute as any <hi>Monarch,</hi> nor is the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> such a <hi>Curb</hi> or <hi>Clog</hi> to Him as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. There are certain things which seem heavy and burthensome, as the <hi>Wings of Birds, Wheels of Chariots,</hi> and the like; which on the contrary make the burthen but the lighter and easier; and one of these things is the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>King;</hi> and both together composing that <hi>Harmony of Government,</hi> which renders it sweet and pleasant, both to <hi>command</hi> and to <hi>obey.</hi>

                  <p>THe <hi>Idea</hi> which I have framed of these <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,</hi> is to spin them out into as fine a <hi>Thred</hi> as I can, and then weave them into a handsome stuff. Of which, I find I have faln so far short in many of them, as though it pleased the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> of glorious memory, to say, <hi>Some of them were the best as ever he had read.</hi> Did I not hope to mend them in another <hi>Impression,</hi> I should be ashamd to let them pass in <hi>this.</hi> I pass then my Thoughts thorough finer and finer <hi>Sieves</hi> of first <hi>Writing,</hi> then <hi>Printing,</hi> and lastly <hi>Reprinting</hi> them before I have done with them; and after all, to think to clear them of all their faults, were to think to sweep an <hi>Earthen Floor</hi> to the last Grain of Dust. I onely then shall undertake the more <hi>obvious,</hi> and leave the rest—But I say no more, least I should be thought one of those who had rather err, and confess it afterwards, than provide before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand not to err at all.</p>
